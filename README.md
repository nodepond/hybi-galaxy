**Chatmosphere is an open source project that aims to make video calls informal and natural**. We missed the dynamics of a self-organizing crowd hanging out at one big table together. The big table in a bar, where so many discussions, jokes, comforting talks, utopias and ideas happen. With chatmosphere you can move and zoom in the area and hear people that are located near by louder and have dynamic talks. To learn more about the Chatmosphere project and ideas have a look in our [ABOUT.md](docs/ABOUT.md)
